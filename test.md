Hey all! 

This is quick message to let you all that know my first extremely fun and informational programming lesson will be next Monday the 26th starting at 7pm EST. For about an hour we will start at the very basics assuming no previous knowledge. 

If anyone is still interested after the first lesson, the plan is to have a lesson weekly and maybe work our way up to making things like discord bots, or maybe trying out some game jams at some point in the future. No stress, no pressure. A relaxed environment if you are interested in trying to learn a new skill. 

The class is opened to everyone, in or out of the discord, feel free to invite anyone. I have configured the discord server in a way that the channels we all use will remain private to everyone already in the server. All new members to the server will only see the public boyos section that contains the public-chat, voice, and classroom.
